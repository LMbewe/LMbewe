</div>

**Project Overview:**  

Developed a collaborative and content-based recommender system designed to predict user ratings for anime titles they have not yet viewed, leveraging their historical preferences. 

Developed a robust anime recommender system capable of accurately predicting user preferences based on viewing history, ratings, and preferences, with performance validated using RMSE. Designed the Fusion-X Network app using Streamlit, featuring an engaging and user-friendly interface for seamless exploration of recommendations. Engineered the system for scalability, ensuring efficient handling of large data volumes and optimal performance during peak usage. Carefully selected and optimized the best-fit model from multiple algorithms to meet project requirements, showcasing expertise in machine learning, user experience design, and system scalability.

🛠️ Tech Environment: Python, pandas, scikit-learn, Seaborn, NLTK, opinion_lexicon, WordCloud 🤖 Machine Learning: SVD ✨ Highlights: Secured 11th place in the Kaggle anime recommender system competition after successfully submitting a prediction, highlighting our proficiency in recommendation models.. 📂 View Repository https://github.com/LMbewe/Unsupervised-Learning-Team-OA-1.git

**Project Overview:**

This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to analyze water quality data from rivers and streams in Buenos Aires, focusing on pollution trends and their implications for both the environment and public health. By assessing water samples taken from key locations, we identified pollution patterns over time, helping to uncover critical insights about the health of these water bodies and the risks posed by pollution. The findings contribute to ongoing efforts in monitoring and mitigating environmental and health risks associated with polluted river systems.

🛠️ Tech Environment: Python, pandas, scikit-learn, Seaborn, NLTK, TfidfVectorizer, WordCloud 🤖 Machine Learning: Gradient Boosting Regressor ✨ Highlights: The model has fit the training data almost perfectly  📂 View Repository https://github.com/LMbewe/Water-Pollution-Project.git
